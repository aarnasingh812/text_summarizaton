It is notable for requiring less training time than previous recurrent neural architectures, such as long short-term memory (LSTM),[2] and its later variation has been prevalently adopted for training large language models on large (language) datasets, such as the Wikipedia corpus and Common Crawl, by virtue of the parallelized processing of input sequence.[3] Input text is split into n-grams encoded as tokens and each token is converted into a vector via looking up from a word embedding table. At each layer, each token is then contextualized within the scope of the context window with other (unmasked) tokens via a parallel multi-head attention mechanism allowing the signal for key tokens to be amplified and less important tokens to be diminished. Though the transformer paper was published in 2017, the softmax-based attention mechanism was proposed earlier in 2014 by Bahdanau, Cho, and Bengio for machine translation,[4][5] and the Fast Weight Controller, similar to a transformer, was proposed in 1992 by Schmidhuber.[6][7][8]\n",
